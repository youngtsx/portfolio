    <div>
        <p>I am a recent Masters Graduate in Information Systems from UH Manoa working at Hawaiian Airlines under the Field Services team. I bring a combination of technical expertise and analytical thinking that bridges IT operations and analytical decision making.
            <br><br>
            I served as an Associate Operations Specialist supporting corporate users in office or remotely. I supported high-priority IT initiatives in a fast-paced, mission critical environment. My work included breakfixes, imaging, asset management, and support on operational projects.
            
            As for process improvements, I developed an application on PowerApps which streamlined the E-waste input process for our technicians by removing manual inputs and integrated various platforms. 



            I worked with ServiceNow, Active Directory, Microsoft Configuration Manager, Intune, and Powershell to support users.
